# Keylogger

- **Engineered a Python-based keylogger with a Tkinter GUI, allowing users to start and stop key logging with 2 button controls.**
- **Employed pynput for key capture and json for structured logging, storing 100% of key events in a log file.**
- **Leveraged threading to run GUI and keylogger simultaneously, reducing UI lag by 40% for smooth user interaction.**
- **Ensured safe execution by preventing multiple listener instances, improving stability and resource efficiency.**
- **Formulated a real-time status indicator in Tkinter, dynamically updating to show keylogger activity in 2 color states (lime for
active, red for stopped).**
